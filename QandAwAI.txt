The women's college level leagues are NCAA Division I Womens Football, NCAA Division I Women's Basketball, NCAA Womens Division I Hockey.

2. question: Structure of the Input: How would you like the user to input the league? Should it be a selection from a predefined list, and if so, do you want the input to be case-insensitive?
2. answer: It should be a selection from a predefined list and the input should be case-insensitive.

3. question: Handling Different Leagues: How should the program handle leagues with different rules within the same sport, level, and game type? Should it differentiate and display rules for each selected league separately, or should it combine them into a single set of rules?
3. answer: It should differentiate and display rules for each selected league separately.

Set2

1. question: Sport and Level Prompt Sequence: How should the user input be sequenced? Should the program first ask for the sport, then the level, and finally the specific league? For example, the flow would be: "Select sport" -> "Select level" -> "Select league".
1. answer: The program should first ask for the sport, then the level, and finally the specific league.

2. question: Data Structure for Rules: Given the variety of leagues and levels, would you prefer the rules database to be structured in a nested dictionary format (e.g., sport -> level -> league -> game type) to handle the differentiation more clearly, or do you have another preferred data structure in mind?
2. answer: I would prefer the rules database to be structured in a nested dictionary format (e.g., sport -> level -> league -> game type)

3. question: Additional Features on Web Page: Besides displaying the overtime rules, timeouts, challenges, and countdown clock, are there any additional features or information you would like to include on the web page? For instance, would you like to show historical data, recent changes in rules, or league-specific regulations?
3. answer: There are no other additional features or information I would like to include on the web page at this time.

Set3

1. question: User Experience: Would you prefer the user interface for input to be text-based (e.g., command line) or a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience? Additionally, would you like any validation checks or error messages to guide the user if they input invalid data?
1. answer: I would prefer the user interface for input to be a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.  Yes, I would like validation checks or error messages to guide the user if they input invalid data.

2. question: Display Format: How would you like the information to be displayed on the web page? Should it be in a simple text format, or do you prefer a more structured layout with sections and headings for each type of information (e.g., separate sections for rules, timeouts, challenges, and countdown clock)?
2. answer: I would like the information to be displayed on the web page in a more structured layout with sections and headings for each type of information (e.g., separate sections for rules, timeouts, challenges, and countdown clock).

3. question: Frequency of Rule Updates: How often do you anticipate the overtime rules to change, and how would you like to handle updates to the rules database? Would you prefer a manual update process, or should the program include functionality to periodically check and update the rules automatically?
3. answer: I would prefer a manual update process for now.


Instruction:
Please do not write any code.  I want to update the RULES_DATABASE dictionary with the following updates:  The men's professional leagues are NFL (National Football League), NBA (National Basketball Association), MLB (Major League Baseball), and NHL (National Hockey League).
The women's professional leagues are WFA (Women's Football Alliance), WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association), and PWHL (Professional Women's Hockey League).
The men's college level leagues are NCAA Mens D1 (NCAA Division I Mens Football), NCAA Mens D1 (NCAA Division I Mens Basketball), NCAA Mens D1 (NCAA Division I Mens Baseball), NCAA Mens D1 (NCAA Division I Mens Hockey).
The women's college level leagues are NCAA Womens D1 (NCAA Division I Womens Football), NCAA Womens D1 (NCAA Division I Women's Basketball), NCAA Womens D1 (NCAA Womens Division I Hockey).  Please ask me three clarifying questions regarding this update.

Set1

1. question: Naming Conventions for College Levels: For both men's and women's college level leagues, you have listed "NCAA Mens D1" and "NCAA Womens D1" for multiple sports (e.g., football, basketball). Should we differentiate these within the dictionary by including the sport in the key (e.g., ncaa_mens_d1_football, ncaa_mens_d1_basketball) to avoid any ambiguity?
2. answer: We should not have to as the sport is picked first before the league and the same league name is used for multiple mens and womens sports.

2. question: Structure of the Dictionary: Should the dictionary structure follow a nested format that includes the sport at the top level, followed by the level (college or professional), and then the specific league? For example:
2. answer: Yes, the dictionary structure should follow a nested format that includes the sport at the top level, followed by the level (college or professional), and then the specific league.  Your example look almost the way I would like, however I would like the level order to be professional then college.

3. question: Detailed Rules for Each League: Do you have specific overtime rules, timeouts, and challenges information for each league, or should we use the example data provided earlier for the initial setup? If you have specific rules, could you provide details for each league?
3. answer: I don't have specific overtime rules, timeouts, and challenges information for each league yet so you should use the example data provided earlier for the initial setup.

Set2

1. question: Handling Duplicate League Names: Since the same league name is used for multiple men's and women's sports at the college level (e.g., "NCAA Mens D1"), would you prefer the dictionary to handle these cases by using a nested structure that separates men’s and women’s categories explicitly within each sport? For example:
1. answer: No, I would rather aviod further nesting and use NCAA Mens D1 and NCAA Womens D1 as the league names since the name reflects whether it is a mens or womens league.

2. question: Level Display Order: Since the dictionary should be structured with the level order as professional first, followed by college, how would you like this order to be reflected in the user interface for selecting the level? Should the dropdown menu for levels also display "Professional" first and then "College"?
2. answer: Yes, the user interface for selecting the level should display "Professional" first and then "College in the dropdown menu for levels.

3. question: Initial Data Validation: Would you like the program to include an initial data validation step to ensure that all expected sports, levels, and leagues are present in the RULES_DATABASE? This could help catch any missing entries or inconsistencies early on.
3. answer: Yes.

Set3

1. question: Overtime Rules Format: How would you like the overtime rules to be presented within the dictionary? Should the rules be detailed and broken down into specific components (e.g., duration, scoring rules, sudden death, etc.), or would a single descriptive text field suffice for now?
1. answer: The rules should be broken down into specific components (decrtiptive text overview, duration, scoring rules, sudden death, timeouts, and challenges).

2. question: Timeouts and Challenges Information: For the timeouts and challenges information, would you prefer to have them in a nested dictionary under each league with separate keys for timeouts and challenges, or should they be included as part of the same dictionary entry as the overtime rules?
1. answer: I would prefer to have them in a nested dictionary under each league and under each game type with separate keys for decrtiptive text overview, duration, scoring rules, sudden death, timeouts, and challenges.

3. question: User Interface Design: Would you like the GUI to provide additional information or options when selecting a sport or level? For instance, should there be descriptions or tooltips explaining what each level or league entails to assist users in making their selections?
3. answer: No.

Set4
1. question: Data Structure for Specific Components: For each component of the overtime rules (descriptive text overview, duration, scoring rules, sudden death, timeouts, and challenges), should there be any specific format or constraints on the data? For example, should the duration always be in minutes, or should the scoring rules follow a specific syntax or structure?
1. answer: For each component of the overtime rules the format or constraint is as follows: 
descriptive text overview not more than a paragraph
duration in minutes less than 720
scoring rules in order of importance
sudden death will be either a yes or no
timeouts a positive integer number less than 5
challenges a positive integer number less than 5 

2. question: Updating the Rules Database: Considering the nested structure for the overtime rules, timeouts, and challenges, how would you like to manage updates to this data? Should there be a specific format for submitting updates (e.g., a structured form or CSV file), and who would be responsible for these updates?
2. answer: We will address this later.
