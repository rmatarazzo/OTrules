Updated: 2024.05.17

Project Name: "OT Rules"
	
Project and Work Product Description:  (should be 1 CONCISE paragraph, 3-7 sentences)
	Retrieve and display current overtime rules for football, basketball, hockey, and baseball across men's and women's college and professional leagues. Differentiate between preseason, regular season, and playoff rules, and provide timeout and challenge details if relevant. Present all information, including an overtime countdown clock, on a web page dashboard.
		
	• Answer "This project / work product (solution) fills these gaps... 
		This project fills these gaps by providing a comprehensive solution for retrieving and displaying current overtime rules across various sports, including football, basketball, hockey, and baseball, in both men's and women's college and professional leagues. It addresses the need for easily accessible and differentiated rules for different game types (preseason, regular season, playoffs), along with timeout and challenge details, if applicable. Additionally, it offers the convenience of presenting all this information on a web page dashboard, complete with an overtime countdown clock.
		
	• Main goals and problem(s) it solves.
		The main goals of this project are to streamline the process of accessing and understanding overtime rules across different sports and leagues. It solves the problem of manual search and comparison by automating the retrieval and differentiation of rules. Furthermore, it enhances user experience by presenting the information in a clear and organized manner on a web page dashboard, facilitating quick reference and decision-making during games.

Description of Solution:  (should be CONCISE, 3-7 sentences)
	get_user_input(): This function collects the user's choices regarding the sport, league, and game type.
	query_overtime_rules(): This function fetches the relevant overtime rules from the database based on the user's input.
	differentiate_rules(): This function ensures that the rules are formatted correctly and differentiated by game type (preseason, 	regular season, and playoffs).
	get_timeouts_and_challenges(): This function extracts additional game information such as timeouts and challenges, if applicable.
	setup_countdown_clock(): This function sets up a visual timer for the overtime period.
	display_on_web_page(): This function outputs all the gathered and formatted information to the web interface for the user to view.

	• Software functions for solving problem(s) step by step.
